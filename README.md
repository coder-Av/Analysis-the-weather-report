(idea ,airtel,j , Vodafone) Will intimate them about rainfall through sms due to problem of scarcity Smartphones with them they are unable get exact wether report. So, they are Not getting intimates from government so, they are losing there livelihood also It very big loss to them some of them not only lossing their livelihood also lives This all are becuase of delay intimation from dam officers and also unconditional Climate in that areas this problem will rectify by our project called analysis of
